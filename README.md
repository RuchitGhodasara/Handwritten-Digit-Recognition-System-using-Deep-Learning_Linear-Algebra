# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-System-using-Deep-Learning_Linear-Algebra
As an application of Linear Algebra, a course we had in semester 4, we asked to make a project in any suitable domain. We chose Neural networks from the Deep Learning as our domain as the calculations happening in the network, while training or testing, are in a form of matrixes. We were group of 3 who learnt this new subject from the scratch and got the essence of the mechanism. Although could not submit a good final report, me did our best while making a power point presentation that we had presented before our professor. We Acknowledge 3Blue1Brown channel as its playlist on a neural networks were became lighthouse for us with its rich and easy to learn animation videos.

### Abstract:

'Artificial neural networks' are a type of 
computing system, inspired by the biological neural structures 
of the brain. A range of neural networks has been in use across 
the disciplines due to their ability to model real-life nonlinear 
processes. Specifically, a neural network that can recognize 
handwritten digits is discussed here.

We have explained Feed-Forward neural network, a simple kind from many of the different types of neural networks, in our PPT. The code, however, uses inbuilt libraries that is constructed upon Convolution Neural Network.

Comparing with current advanced 'Deep learning' and 'Artificial intelligence', it is elementary level modelling but then also, had provided a key start to our understanding.



### Results:

We have a code that recognize the feded 28*28 pixel image of handwritten digits and predicts the output with around 95% accurecy.
